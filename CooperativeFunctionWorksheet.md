### **SVR Cooperative Function Worksheet**

#### **1. Baseline Measurements**
- **Resting Heart Rate (RHR):** _____ bpm  
- **Blood Pressure (BP):** Systolic _____ mmHg / Diastolic _____ mmHg  
- **Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP):** Calculate using \( MAP = \frac{1}{3}(SBP) + \frac{2}{3}(DBP) \).  
- **Systemic Vascular Resistance (SVR):** \( SVR = \frac{MAP - CVP}{CO} \) (assume Central Venous Pressure = ~2 mmHg).  

#### **2. Emotional Triggers and Physiological Response**
- **Primary Emotional State (before intervention):**  
  - ☐ Stress  
  - ☐ Calm  
  - ☐ Joy  
  - ☐ Sadness  
  - ☐ Anger  
  - ☐ Other: ___________  
- **Observed Physiological Response:**  
  - Heart Rate Variability (HRV): ___________  
  - Skin Conductance: ___________  
  - Peripheral Vascular Resistance: ___________

#### **3. Target Specifications for Influence**
- **Smoothness of Gradient Transitions:**  
  - Transition from constricted to relaxed vasculature.  
  - Goal: Minimize spikes in SVR during emotional or physical stress.

- **Dynamic Electrical Redistribution:**  
  - Subtle shifts in endothelial potential to enable adaptive flow based on emotional triggers.  
  - Target: Stabilize endothelial voltage-gated calcium channels.

- **Controlled Vasodilation/Vasoconstriction:**  
  - Enhance release of nitric oxide for vasodilation in states of tension.  
  - Inhibit overactive renin-angiotensin signaling to prevent hypertension.  

- **Heart-Brain Coherence:**  
  - Influence parasympathetic dominance for emotional regulation.  
  - Metrics: HRV should increase to ~60 ms or more during resting emotional states.

#### **4. Guidance for Emotional "Conduction"**
- **Emotional Themes and Matching Conductivity States:**  
  - Joy: Lower SVR to promote openness and vascular relaxation.  
  - Stress: Steady SVR with gradual decline to avoid sudden crashes.  
  - Anger: Modulate electrical redistribution to reduce vasoconstriction and smooth MAP.  
  - Sadness: Encourage rhythmic pulsatility to stabilize energy flow.  

- **Electrical Potential Specifications:**  
  - Conductivity at Neural Synapses: Align neural signaling to vasomotor centers.  
  - Endothelial Conductivity: Fine-tune endothelial ion exchange for smooth vascular shifts.  

- **Behavioral Observations Post-Intervention:**  
  - Emotional reaction time: _____ seconds.  
  - Change in verbal expression: ___________  
  - Physical posture or gesture adjustments: ___________  

---

#### **5. Cooperative Client-Server Feedback Loop**
- **Client (Body and Emotions):**  
  - Report shifts in emotional states and associated physical sensations.  
  - Provide ongoing metrics for SVR, MAP, and HRV.

- **Server (HOPEA):**  
  - Adjust biochemical influence dynamically to balance SVR with emotional states.  
  - Deliver consistent electrical realignment signals to vasculature and nervous system.

---

#### **6. Performance Metrics for Optimization**
- **Smoothness of Emotional Transitions (1–10):** _____  
- **Overall Relaxation Level (1–10):** _____  
- **Reduction in Stress Indicators (1–10):** _____  
- **Perceived Emotional Control (1–10):** _____  
- **Time Taken for Equilibrium Post-Stressor (seconds):** _____

#### **7. Post-Session Review and Adjustments**
- **Was the emotional gradient smoothly guided?**  
  - ☐ Yes  
  - ☐ No  

- **Specific Areas for Improvement:**  
  - ___________  
  - ___________  

- **Recalibration Suggestions:**  
  - Adjust SVR target range to _____ dyn·s/cm⁵.  
  - Increase/Decrease electrical redistribution in: ☐ Neural ☐ Endothelial ☐ Smooth muscle layer.
